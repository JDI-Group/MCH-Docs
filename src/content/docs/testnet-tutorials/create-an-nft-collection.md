# Publishing an NFT Collection on Moonchain (Hudson)

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of publishing an NFT collection on the Moonchain NFT platform using Moonchain. The NFT platform enables creators to mint, showcase, and trade NFTs easily. Follow the steps below to get your NFT collection live on the blockchain.

## Part 1: Publishing an NFT collection with Metamask 

### Prerequisites
Before publishing your NFT collection on the Moonchain NFT platform using MetaMask, ensure the following:

1. **MetaMask Installed and Set Up:** Make sure MetaMask is installed in your browser and configured correctly.
2. **Connect to Hudson Testnet:** Add the Hudson Testnet to MetaMask 
3. **Prepare Your NFT Assets:** Ensure your NFT images, metadata, and descriptions are ready for upload.
4. **Sufficient Test Tokens:** Obtain test tokens (MCH) from the Moonchain [Hudson Testnet Faucet](https://Hudson-faucet.mchain.ai/) to cover gas fees during minting.

### Steps to publish

1. **Connect Wallet:** Open MetaMask and connect it to the Moonchain platform.

3. **Fill in Collection Details:** To set up your NFT collection on the Moonchain platform, start by filling in the required fields: enter the collection’s name, upload the cover (300x300 recommended) and profile images (1200x300 recommended), provide a description, and set the creator earnings percentage. Additional customization options include adding a unique URL (each MCH domain can only be assigned to one NFT collection), selecting categories and tags, and linking your social media. Once completed, click "Save Collection" and confirm the transaction in MetaMask to finalize the setup.

4. **Upload Artwork and Mint NFTs:** Upload Artwork and Mint NFTs: To mint your NFT, fill in the required fields such as the item name, image, description, collection details, and relevant traits. The MCH N3XUS provisioning option is available for linking NFTs with real-world latitude and longitude data, enhancing RWA-NFTs, but this feature is optional and not used in our process. Once completed, click on 'Create Item' and confirm the transaction in MetaMask to finalize your NFT on the blockchain.

   4.1 **Optional: Lock XSD Tokens:**  
   You can choose to lock XSD tokens into your NFT, which boosts the NFT’s credibility and ensures security by linking tangible value. The XSD tokens can only be reclaimed if the NFT is permanently burnt (sent to a blackhole address), safeguarding the asset's integrity and maintaining trust in its real-world backing. This step is optional and not required for the standard NFT minting process.

5. **View and Manage your Collection:** Once your item is deployed, you can view it under the 'Collections' tab. Click on your collection to see all included NFTs. Selecting an individual item will take you to its detailed page, where you can offer the NFT for sale or transfer it to another wallet. This feature allows you to manage and interact with your NFTs directly, giving you full control over trading and ownership options on the platform.

## Part 2: Publishing an NFT collection with MCH
