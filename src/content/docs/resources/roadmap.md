# Roadmap 2025



# **MOONCHAIN ($MCH) 2025 ROADMAP**

Our 2025 roadmap is a strategic four-phase plan designed to build, scale, and mature the Moonchain ecosystem. Each quarter builds upon the last, systematically transforming Moonchain from a foundational ZK framework into a thriving, self-sustaining AI-agent data economy.

## **üöÄ Q1: Foundation - Deployment & AI Integration**

*The first quarter is dedicated to launching our core infrastructure and activating the initial economic loops. We will lay the technical foundation with our zkEVM and begin bridging the decentralized AI world into the $MCH ecosystem.*

*   **Launch Moonchain zkEVM Framework:** Deploy the core engine of our network, enabling scalable, private, and verifiable off-chain AI computations. This establishes the bedrock of trust for all future operations.
*   **Activate AI Data Relaying:** Implement the first live use case of our value relayer, allowing us to verifiably bridge data from third-party decentralized networks and translate their activity into on-chain value.
*   **Ignite the IHO Mining Engine:** Launch the $MCH token mining mechanism for our established community of IHO miners and MXC holders, ensuring a seamless transition and immediate, tangible rewards for our most loyal supporters.
*   **Build Bridges with Staking Partnerships:** Begin onboarding data-centric tokens from third-party AI projects, allowing their communities to participate in the Moonchain ecosystem and expanding our multi-token staking environment from day one.

&nbsp;

## **üåê Q2: Scale - IHO Growth & Ecosystem Expansion**

*With the foundation in place, Q2 focuses on aggressive network growth and deepening economic incentives. We will scale our physical hardware network globally while introducing more sophisticated staking mechanisms to increase participation and TVL.*

*   **Global IHO Rollout:** Launch the second major wave of Initial Hardware Offerings (IHOs), strategically targeting new global regions to rapidly expand the physical footprint of our decentralized hardware network.
*   **Enhance Staking Incentives:** Introduce direct hardware staking rewards, allowing users who stake their $MCH tokens to earn enhanced yields, further increasing the incentive to lock tokens and support the network.
*   **Launch Multi-Token Staking:** Fully promote and expand the multi-token staking mechanism, allowing users to stake a variety of partner tokens (e.g., from other Layer 2 data networks) to earn rewards within the Moonchain economy.
*   **Decentralize Network Governance:** Take the first step towards community-led governance by launching proposals for establishing universal AI data verification standards, empowering our community to shape the future of network integrity.

&nbsp;

## **üß† Q3: Utility - AI Value Layer Expansion**

*This quarter is about maturing Moonchain from a hardware network into a fully-fledged AI service layer. We will launch powerful new tools and services that leverage the data and compute power generated by our scaled network.*

*   **Enable Cross-Network Value Relaying:** Fully activate the protocol's ability to act as a universal bridge, relaying verified data and value between different AI networks and solidifying Moonchain's role as a central hub.
*   **Launch AI & Data Oracle System:** Deploy a native oracle on the Moonchain zkEVM, providing other dApps and protocols with a secure, reliable, and verifiable source of real-world data generated by our DePIN network.
*   **Deploy Internal Network Intelligence:** Begin running our own AI-powered predictive models on the network to optimize performance, forecast demand, and intelligently allocate resources, creating a self-improving system.
*   **Deepen Ecosystem Integration:** Expand strategic partnerships with leading AI and DePIN projects, integrating them more deeply into our value relayer and oracle systems to create powerful network effects.

&nbsp;

## **ü§ñ Q4: Economy - AI-Agent Data Market**

*The final quarter focuses on maturing the $MCH economy and opening the floodgates for developer innovation. We will upgrade the token's core utility and provide the tools for a new generation of decentralized AI applications to be built on Moonchain.*

*   **Mature the $MCH Economy:** Launch a significant $MCH utility upgrade, enhancing staking rewards, introducing gas fee reduction mechanisms for active participants, and expanding governance power. We will also launch the ability for partner token stakers to directly mine $MCH, creating a powerful symbiotic relationship.
*   **Global Narrative Push:** Execute a major global marketing campaign centered on our core, unified identity: **‚ÄúAI + DePIN + zk = Moonchain‚Äù**. This will crystallize our position as the undisputed leader at the intersection of these key technologies.
*   **Empower Developers with the Moonchain SDK:** Release the official Moonchain Software Development Kit (SDK), providing AI developers with all the tools they need to easily build and deploy their own applications on our powerful, secure, and cost-effective zkEVM layer.

Sincerely, 

Moonchain Team
